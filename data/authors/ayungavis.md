Hi! I'm Wahyu, a software engineer with a background in programming and design. I've enjoyed experiences in web and mobile development especially as a front end developer.

Currently I'm focused on building applications with sensible user interfaces and good user experiences that help people discover and connect with each other. My mission is to make technology more accessible and enjoyable to the masses and I love exploring new technology to accomplish that.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably dreaming about building great user interface design and code it. I also enjoy drinking coffee ☕️
